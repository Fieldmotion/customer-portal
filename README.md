# customer-portal
Embeddable customer portal widget

## Installation Instructions

Place the following code where you want the portal to appear on your website, with the `CID` part replaced with your FieldMotion client ID:

```html
<script data-cid="CID" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fieldmotion/customer-portal@20181022/portal.js" id="fm-customer-portal"></script><a href="https://fieldmotion.com/">FieldMotion</a>
```

Alterntaively if you want to use the most recent non-released master version of the portal (warning: may bite), use the following:

```html
<script data-cid="CID" src="https://rawgit.com/Fieldmotion/customer-portal/master/portal.js" id="fm-customer-portal"></script><a href="https://fieldmotion.com/">FieldMotion</a>
```
